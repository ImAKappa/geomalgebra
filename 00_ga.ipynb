It's a very powerful framework, but it does have some quirks, like how the [cross product is only well-defined in 3 and 7 dimensions](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/185991/is-the-vector-cross-product-only-defined-for-3d), or how vectors are used to represent high-dimensional things even though vectors are really still just one dimensional."

Plus, all sorts of seemingly distinct entities like quarternions, and even imaginary numbers, just spontaneously arise from a few simple multiplication rules. I don't want to spoil too much at this point, so that's all I will say for now."
