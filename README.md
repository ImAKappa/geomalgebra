## Overview

The tutorial is organized roughly according to chapters 1 - 3 of
Geometric Algebra Primer by Jaap Suter (2003). A copy of the pdf is
included in the [repository](https://github.com/ImAKappa/geomalgebra).
Suter explains the theory very well, so I wanted these notes to focus
more on implementation.

Some topics covered:

-   [x] Subspaces
-   [x] Basis Blades (scalar, vector, bivector)
-   [x] Multivectors
-   [x] Geometric Product

## Install

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/ImAKappa/some2.git

conda create -n some2 python=3.10 --file some2-env.txt
```

Tested on Windows WSL2 for Python 3.10. The minimum supported Python
version is 3.10, but can be adapted to 3.9 by modifying syntax for type
hints and some standard library functions.

## Learn Geometric Algebra

Beyond this tutorial, I recommend viewing these resources in the
following order:

-   [Geometric Algebra Primer
    (2003)](http://www.jaapsuter.com/geometric-algebra.pdf): Very
    approachable. It’s so great that I have included a copy in this
    repository. Throughout the tutorials I will refer to the relevant
    sections.

-   [Linear and Geometric Algebra (Alan Macdonald,
    2011)](http://www.faculty.luther.edu/~macdonal/laga/). Great intro
    to the subject with lots of practice problems.

-   [Geometric Algebra (Thesis by Daniel Fontijne,
    2007)](https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/4375498/52687_fontijne.pdf):
    Straightforward intro to GA. Includes notes on implementation. See
    also [Geometric Algebra for Computer Science (Dorst, Fontijne, Mann,
    2007-2009)](https://geometricalgebra.org/) which is a textbook that
    expands on the thesis.

-   [Bivector.net](https://bivector.net/tools.html): Basically the
    geometric algebra fanclub website. More explanations in the form of
    papers, conferences, code, and videos can be found here.

## Background

Last year, I came across a kind of math called Geometric Algebra (GA).
It was interesting because proponents said it’s like linear algebra but
more suitable for geometrical applications. I was a bit skeptical since
it was a bit obscure, but figured why not try to learn it.

The theory was not too bad to get the hang of, but it was much harder
for me to grok numerical GA. In my head there was a big disconnect
between symbolic manipulations of GA and corresponding computer
implementations. I found many neat libraries like
[Ganja.js](https://github.com/enkimute/ganja.js),
[Clifford](https://github.com/pygae/clifford), and
[Klein](https://github.com/jeremyong/klein). They were nice to use, but
their implementations were a bit too complicated for me. I figured if I
wanted to understand numerical GA better, I needed to try and implement
my own GA library. “But maybe later” I said, not really knowing where to
start.

When 3Blue1Brown announced the SoME2, I found the motivation to actually
start the project. It was a bit tricky to put together a GA
implementation that was understandable, not only to myself, but to other
people. Hopefully I succeeded, or at least got a few new people
interested in GA. Of course, the repository won’t be abandoned after the
competition ends. My next goal is to explain and implement a very
interesting flavour of geometric algebra called Plane-Based Geometric
Algebra. But that’s a project for future me.
